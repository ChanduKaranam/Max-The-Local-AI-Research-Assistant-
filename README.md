# Max-The-Local-AI-Research-Assistant-
Max is a locally running AI assistant built for privacy. It runs offline, uses fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2, processes images with Moondream2, speaks with Kokoro TTS, and counters hallucination with RAG. No data is sent online, ensuring full confidentiality. Only its web crawler uses the internet.
