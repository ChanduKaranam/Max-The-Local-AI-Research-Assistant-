# Max-The-Local-AI-Research-Assistant-
Max is a locally running AI assistant built for privacy. It runs offline, uses fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2, processes images with Moondream2, speaks with Kokoro TTS, and counters hallucination with RAG. No data is sent online, ensuring full confidentiality. Only its web crawler uses the internet.

Max is a Local running research assistant made to combat the modern problem of data privacy while using AI from companies as the private data that we enter in these AIs is stored in the databases of these companies which can be used to train these models or this databases could be hacked by people with malicious intent . This is a huge problem for people who need to use the capabilities of these AIs but can't let there data being used by these companies or being leaked to malicious sources . People in the professions with client confidentiality can't let the data/information of there users get leaked out as it would be disastrous . Max is the solution for all of these problems , Max is a locally running AI with all of the features of these huge AI's with no worry of you data leaking out as all the processes are run in the local system itself . Max is made of a fine tuned Llama3.2 : 3b on 5000 conversational dialogues dataset so Max is always ready to chat with you and brighten you day or make the complex topics more easy to understand . Max can counter AI hallucination by using RAG(Retrieval-augmented generation) which will help it gain new knowledge based and be up to date on the information and not give the user a made up answer . Max can process images and analyse them so that it can help the user with visual related problems and analysis using a open sourced model called Moondream2 which runs locally with only 2B parameters . Max can also talk to it's users with speech recognition with faster-whisper and talk to us with human like voice using kokoro TTS all of which are open sourced and run locally . Most of the features in max run offline with no internet required at all , the only feature that needs the use of internet is our WebCrawler which uses crawl4ai a new open sourced web scrapper that enters and website and gets all the information from it so that Max can understand about the website which the user want's to know about . Max is set to get more and more advanced in the future with the integration of new features , so look forward to it .
